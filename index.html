                                <h4>How Brains Perceive Pain</h4>
                                <span>What makes some percieve<br>better than others?</span>
                                <p>One of the most fascinating things to study for me is what makes noticable patterns of variation within a species, especially with respect to social behavior. Variations like dominance, aggression, succeptibility to anxiety and high or low ability in sensory perception translate into differences in response during social interaction. Empathy for pain is no different- an individual's response to observing another in pain can vary, and these individual differences create the canvas of life that we all experience.<br><br>To stay flexible as a species, it is advantageous to have a portion of the population to be very adaptive and responsive to stimuli while the rest of the population is fine doing business as usual. This results in what we might call personality differences or clusters of differently reactive individuals to stimuli. I am interested in the natural variation of perception of pain in others and the possible correlation of that with individual succeptibility to chronic pain conditions, or in other words how the ability to communicate pain relates to the perception of self-experienced pain. Do people who perceive that others are in pain very well also experience pain themselves at a more intense rate than those who don't really notice pain in others?<br><br>And to dive deeper into that, when an individual perceives pain in others, what brain regions are involved? The prelimbic cortex has been implicated in a number of behaviors including social contexts, memory, and homeostatic resource-seeking. I want to measure neural activity in the mPFC during the perception of others in pain and trace the connecting brain regions to dissect the circuits involved, and compare to the circuitry that senses pain in the self. I will then begin to compare differences in neural activity and neurobiology between mice that sense well and mice that do not.</p>

                                <span>How does the brain perceive pain?</span>
                                <p>Pain is a complex phenomenon in that it involves the peripheral and central nervous system, and it is composed of both sensory components reflecting the intensity of the signal as well as affective components reflecting the unpleasantness of the signal. What is even more interesting is that research on human participants has shown that when an individual has experienced social rejection or is observing another person in pain, a subset ofoverlapping brain regions are active compared to if that person actually experienced a physical injury.<br><br>What is not yet known is the connections and directionality of the brain regions involved, the cell types that are active and what the activity pattern looks like during pain perception. My research interests are to compare pain perception to physically experienced pain in mice and to uncover circuit connectivity, cell types involved and neural activity during pain observation in others.</p>

                                <p>As a systems neuroscientist and behavioral psychologist, I utilize a number of different modern technologies to pursue my research questions on the neurobiology of empathy for pain. In addition to lots of behavior analysis (I use a simple keystroke python software to hand-score behaviors), I also look at the neurobiology of the behavior using three main categories of techniques: viral tools to trace neurons, alter function and observe behavior changes and to measure neural activity, molecular techniques to compare protein expression, and behavioral techniques to measure the modulation of pain in different conditions.<br><br>Viral techniques: I bring with me 2 years of experience in the Xiaoke Chen lab at Stanford prior to joining my current PhD program. I practice mouse stereotaxic craniotomy for viral transfection for applications like neural circuit tracing, chemo- and optogenetic manipulation, and genetially encoded indicators, as well as  liquid and optic fiber cannula implantation for pharmacologic manipulation and neurophotonic imaging techniques like fiber photometry. I also use whole-tissue molecular techniques for exploring phenotype differences including immunohistochemistry, traditional FISH and RNAscope on neural tissue. And to measure nociceptive behavioral changes, I use common pain behavior techniques such as von Frey and Hargreavesand hot plate testing, chemical pain assays, conditioned place preference/aversion, and behavioral tests to study animal perception, affect, and sociability behavior. I have recently developed a model of pain observation in mouse same-sex pairs that tests pain perception after a social interaction.</p>

                                <p>Toronto is my current home. I'm originally from Texas and have lived in Georgia and California before joining UofT. I travel to Mississauga to the UTM campus for research but I live in the heart of downtown TO. Toronto is a good big city to live in, lots of diversity, good food, subway and street cars, lots of festivals. Yeah, winter is long here. The grey springtime is the worst. But it makes you appreciate when flowers start to bloom and the weather is nice.</p>

                                <p>My career in science started in the summer of 2007 when Dr. Janice Fisher let me come knock flies in her genetics lab. I've made a winding path since then but asked a lot of questions along the way, fell in love with insect behavior at the end of college, and realized my true love for research was understanding how the brain drives behavior. But every scientist is also a human, so a girl has to have some hobbies. I love keeping up with the news and spend my mornings reading headlines. I live for absurdist comedy and documentary films. I have an indoor garden and love my plant babies. I love video games, especially platform-adventure games and some RPGs like EarthBound, and my husband and I love supporting local comic artists. I enjoy cycling (but Toronto is seriously scary so I'll be sticking to indoor cycling while here). And I love to travel but within reason, see Big Sur above.</p>

                                <p>This photo is my insect collection I made while studying in the entomology graduate program at the University of Georgia. A handful of these specimens are in the UGA collection. I realized while I was there that I really want to study proximal and functional as opposed to ultimate explanations for behavior, so I refocused my energy toward neuroscience and currently study a rodent model of social cognition. But I still really love insects. People always ask me what my favorite insect is... and I can't choose just one. Flies are amazing, wasps, beetles, dragonflies and damselflies, mantises, water scorpions, stick bugs, toad bugs... I heart them all. And before I leave the GTA I'd love to look through a shallow portion of the Credit river to see if I can find stonefly larvae... I've never seen them in the wild.</p>

                                              <h4>Variation in the Perception of Pain in Others - High and Low Responders</h4>
                                                    <span>25 August 2019</span>
                                                    <p>For survival, variation exists among many traits in mammals. One well-studied trait is mothering behavior, first studied in rats when researchers found the variation, selected for high (good) mothering and low (bad) mothering and how this affected the offspring. This particular phenotype is now studied in primates as well by researchers like Mar Sanchez at Emory who looks at how the mothering variation affects primate youth brain development. Research in rats has shown that having a bad mother can make offspring more prone to anxiety-like behaviors as measured by assays like the plus maze. While we can make links to human medical conditions like overwhelming anxiety, having a portion of the population that reacts highly to the environment is actually a positive thing for the species- this subpopulation watches for danger. Variation in the ability to perceive environmental threats, either high response to provide vigilance or low response to not overreact and continue exploration for resources, is highly beneficial.<br><br>

Does variation also exist in the ability to perceive pain in conspecifics? An evolutionary need for caregiving, and a sex difference in the amount of parental care given, would predict that females have more of a capacity for picking up on external cues to provide care, and recent research has shown evidence for more empathy behaviors in female animals. But what about in primate species where the parental care is more equitable (k selection with few offspring that receive a lot of attention) than a species with parenting done more by one parent like in rodents that experience more predation (r selection with many offspring produce, development is much faster and parenting behavior is more limited)? To me this should indicate that a higher percentage of a male primate population would exhibit emotional contagion behaviors than a male rodent population.<br><br>

Rearing offspring is certainly worth considering for the roots of empathy, but why would it benefit a species to pay attention to adult states? Signals from conspecifics can indicate resources and danger. Having two subpopulations, the majority subpopulation with lower responsiveness and a minority subpopulation with a heightened responsiveness to stimuli, is evolutionarily advantageous and has been found in over a hundred species (See “Evolutionary emergence of responsive and unresponsive personalities” by Wolf et al. 2008). And having individuals within the population that have heightened plasticity (change in reaction) to environmental cues gives rise to both the idea of individual plasticity (meaning vulerability during poor conditions causing anxiety or depression but also the ability to thrive better in protected or supported conditions) as well as the survival of the whole species becuase of the vigilance of these individuals (See “Vulnerability genes or plasticity genes?” by Belsky et al. 2009). So it may be the case that empathy can be described both on the need to care for offspring - where sex differences can be observed- but also on the need to perceive cues from conspecifics for understanding the environmental context - where both sexes exhibit variation in high and low response. <br><br>

Does empathy always give rise to compassionate helping behaviors? Is there always a reaching out when an individual is in pain (and running away when the individual is sick)? This is not known yet- we tend to think female humans will approach when they understand the individual is in pain but avoid when the individual is sick, but what if pain is an indicator of environmental threat to prey animals like mice? I am already seeing some interesting variation but it is worth considering that because mice are not predators like rats, they do not display the same robust helping behavior like rats and require a more careful control of environmental influences like noise. I can imagine that overt displays of pain, like screaming, is potentially aversive to all members of a species- an example is it surely takes a lot of courage from first responders, and they must train robustly and put up a guard in their minds, to be able to approach an accident. Compassion response could be based on a variation in environmental responsiveness, the degree of threat perceived based on the pain reaction, or a number of other factors. Purely focusing on social context alone- being around a male or female, stranger or familiar, might not be enough to predict compassion responses or approach behavior, and to me, the evolutionary reason for responding to another in pain (e.g. is the context threatening?) has to be considered during prediction. Whether the environment was perceived as threatening may also be able to predict human responses- do we approach another in pain when we feel we might also be hurt? When we are hurt, and others see our pain as very aversive, how does it affect the healing process? <br><br>

As I gather data on the social communication of pain, I should be able to describe the variation that exists more clearly.</p>

                                              <h4>Pain- The Brain is Vigilant over the Body and its Environment</h4>
                                                    <span>20 July 2019</span>
                                                    <p>The pain field tends to talk about pain in terms of the bio-psycho-social model. As an animal neuroscientist, I tend to like to think about the brain and body being a single entity because psychologists in the past have tried to argue for the special-ness of humans in that our brains posess some non-physical property that lets us create and think and talk. But the reality is all of that capability is within our brains, which is a product of evolution through reproductive success. However, the bio-psycho-social model of pain is still discussed and what this means is a peripheral sensory component picks up signals, and then the central nervous system processess the signals and gives us additional qualities of the pain such as unpleasantness and memory of the event. The social aspect of pain means that even though each of us has the capacity to sense when our bodies are damaged, we also sense when our relationships with each other are threatened and interestingly we can sense suffering in each other. Thus the brain can sense when the body is in trouble and when the environment and social resources are threatened. Thus to fully understand the psychologial phenomenon of pain, we should also consider how the brain detects external signals and how this is similar to internal signals of pain.<br><br>

Pain is a complex experience that involves both peripheral and central biological processing within the nervous system. The peripheral nervous system can process acute signals stemming from damage or disease, while the central nervous system integrates signals and has the potential to become sensitized to result in chronic forms of pain. Chronic pain, or pain that lasts beyond the typical tissue-healing period, is experienced in the central nervous system.<br><br>

Additionally, the brain is capable of sensing what is inside the body, and outside. There is interoception where the brain processes signals, via communicating between emotional and cognitive subregions, relayed from the body in order to sense internal states. There is also exteroception where the brain processes signals relayed from outside the body. The brain is where environmental threats and social signals are processed via communication between emotional and cognitive brain subregions.<br><br>

So the environment or context where the individual is can affect the pain experience via the input coming from outside the body.<br><br>

We know that various influences like how much you trust your physician, how much your physician believes that the treatment and conveys that believe to you will affect your outcome, and the placebo effect based on the belief of the efficacy of a treatment are real means of influencing pain.<br><br>

And we also know that experiencing a painful situation with another individual can enhance or dampen that experience based on research done in mice (Langford, D. J. et al. Social modulation of pain as evidence for empathy in mice. Science 312, 1967–1970 (2006)).<br><br>

At the moment I am trying to characterize a mouse model where two mice interact: one is the observer and one is the demonstrator of pain. I am looking at their behavior during the observation session, and I will be looking at the pain experience of the observer after the session. That work is to come.<br><br>

But I notice that some mice interact more than others. This makes me wonder if some are better at perceiving the painful signal than others, and it makes me wonder why.<br><br>

From the human neuroimaging literature, we know that people who view another person in pain have overlapping brain regions active as if they experienced pain themselves. So I am going to start recording neural activity in the medial prefrontal cortex, which we know is active during self-experienced pain. I'll start diving in to cell types active during pain perception, and then be able to measure what's going on in mice that pay attention to their social partner in pain and mice that don't really seem to care that much. It's a really fun project with lots to explore.
